Fruit Recognition Analysis using MATLAB
What is fruit recognition?
The popular technology used in this innovative era is Computer vision for fruit recognition. Compared to other machine learning (ML) algorithms, deep neural networks (DNN) provide promising results to identify fruits in images. Currently, to identify fruits, different DNN-based classification algorithms are used.
We have used Digital Signal Processing using MATLAB.
